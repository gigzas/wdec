wdec is a decompiler for roblox made by LuaVM

its currently not working since roblox has switched to a newer bytecode version

should be fixable but im a skid so idk how to do it

version 1 - original version posted publicly in sirhurt discord by LuaVM (woffle)

version 2 - has a decompile() function added, thanks to LuaVM (woffle) for help (i begged him to spoonfeed me the code)

version 3 - version 2 but angelware (a friend of mine, a skid but not as much as i am) apparently fixed something, i have no idea what he changed and if he even fixed anything but i trust him ig
